""" Read data from the HTU21D sensor.

A high-level Class to read data from the HTU21D I2C sensor. An instance of
the Class can read *either* temperature *or* humidity; see __init__()
for more detail. 

You must add these lines in sensors.cfg:
[HTU21D-temp]
filename = htu21d
enabled = yes
measurement = temp

[HTU21D-hum]
filename = htu21d√í
enabled = yes
measurement = humidity

        Initialise the HTU21D sensor class using parameters passed in 'data'.
        Instances of this class can be set to monitor either temperature
        ('temp') or humidity ('hum'). This is determined by the contents of
        'data' passed to this __init__ function. If you want to read both
        properties, you'll need two instances of the class.
        When set to read temperature, self.valName is 'Temperature-HTU' to
        differentiate it from other temperature sensors on the AirPi (such as
        the DHT22). By default temperatures are read in Celsius; data["unit"]
        can be set to "F" to return readings in Fahrenheit instead if required.
        Humidity is returned as percentage relative humidity.
        The I2C bus number depending of the version of the PCB is auto detected.
        The access to I2C doesn't need smbus library and so no need of the Adafruit
        library.
